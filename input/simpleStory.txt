John wrote a simply story. A story about his day. John described his day at work, and what he did with his friends.

"I worked from 8-5 today," John wrote, "I had lunch with my coworkers at the new deli down the block."

John spoke of his coworkers: Alice, Matt, and Cat.

After he wrote about his work day, John wrote about his evening.

"My roommate, William, and I went to the suppermarket since we ran out of eggs," John wrote.

John finished writting his story before he went to bed, "I had a productive day!"
